  - Self-healing reports showing what locators were updated
  - Configuration for healing sensitivity levels
  - Integration with AI-powered element detection

### 3. Comprehensive Reporting
- **Objective**: Provide detailed test execution insights
- **Requirements**:
  - HTML reports with screenshots and videos
  - Allure integration for advanced reporting
  - Real-time dashboard capabilities
  - Test metrics and trends analysis
  - Failed test analysis with healing suggestions
  - Integration with CI/CD pipeline notifications

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- **Objective**: Seamless integration with DevOps workflows
- **Requirements**:
  - GitHub Actions workflow templates
  - Jenkins pipeline support
  - Docker containerization
  - Parallel execution capabilities
  - Environment-specific configurations
  - Artifact management for reports and screenshots

### 5. Test Classification System
- **Objective**: Organize and execute tests based on categories
- **Requirements**:
  - Test tagging system (smoke, regression, integration, etc.)
  - Priority-based execution
  - Environment-specific test suites
  - Feature-based test grouping
  - Custom test metadata support

### 6. Multi-Platform Support
- **Objective**: Execute tests across different devices and browsers
- **Requirements**:
  - Desktop browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
  - Mobile browser testing (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
  - Responsive design testing
  - Device-specific configurations
  - Cross-browser compatibility reports

### 7. Reusable Keywords/Actions Library
- **Objective**: Create maintainable, reusable test components
- **Requirements**:
  - Common UI interaction keywords
  - Smart waiting mechanisms
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Parameterized actions
  - Business-logic keywords

### 8. Visual Testing & UI Comparison
- **Objective**: Detect visual regressions automatically
- **Requirements**:
  - Screenshot capture and comparison
  - Baseline image management
  - Difference highlighting
  - Threshold-based acceptance criteria
  - Visual test reporting integration
  - Support for responsive screenshots

### Technology Stack
- **Core**: Cypress with TypeScript
- **Reporting**: Allure, HTML Reporter, Custom Dashboard
- **Visual Testing**: Cypress built-in + Percy/Applitools integration
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker
- **Auto-healing**: Custom implementation with AI integration
- **Configuration**: YAML/JSON based configs

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up project structure and TypeScript configuration
- Implement base Page Object Model architecture
- Create basic keyword library
- Set up initial reporting structure

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)
- Implement auto-healing mechanism
- Add multi-browser and mobile support
- Create test classification system
- Develop visual testing capabilities

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Advanced reporting and dashboards
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation and examples

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (Week 7-8)

## Getting Started with Claude Code

### Initial Setup Commands
```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir Cypress-framework && cd Cypress-framework
npm init -y
npm install @Cypress/test typescript @types/node
npm install --save-dev allure-Cypress allure-commandline

# Initialize TypeScript
npx tsc --init

3. **"Create a comprehensive keyword library with common UI interactions like clickDropdown, selectOption, waitForElement, etc. with proper error handling"**

4. **"Set up visual testing capabilities with screenshot comparison, baseline management, and difference reporting"**

5. **"Create CI/CD pipeline configurations for GitHub Actions with parallel test execution and artifact management"**

6. **"Implement a test classification system using tags and metadata to organize and execute different test types"**

7. **"Add multi-platform support configuration for different browsers and mobile devices"**

8. **"Create comprehensive reporting with Allure integration and custom HTML reports"**
